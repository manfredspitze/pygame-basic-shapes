## Pygame: Drawing Lines with Loops & Offsets

### Overview

Using a `for` loop is a more efficent way to draw many lines quickly.

You can also use an **offset** with a `for` loop when drawing multiple lines.

An **offset** value is the number of pixels by which the starting and ending points of each line you wish to draw are shifted relative to the previous line. 

This allows you to create a series of parallel lines with a consistent spacing between them.

Offset values can be **horizontal** or **vertical**.

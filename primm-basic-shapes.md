## PRIMM: Pygame Shapes

### Predict: What shapes would these lines of code draw?

- `pygame.draw.rect()`
- `pygame.draw.line()`
- `pygame.draw.ellipse()`
- `pygame.draw.polygon()`
- `pygame.draw.circle()`

### Predict: What shape is this?
```python
thickness = 5
pygame.draw.polygon(screen, BLACK, [[100, 100], [0, 200], [200, 200]], thickness)
```
### Code Analysis
- In the line of code below, what do the values of 250 and 100 represent?
- What does the value of 2 at the end of the line of code tell Python to do?
- And what about the values of 20 and 30?  What are they for?
```python
pygame.draw.rect(screen, GREEN, [20, 30, 250, 100], 2)
```
